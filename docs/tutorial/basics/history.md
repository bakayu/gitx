## Viewing Commit History

The most commonly used command to view the history of commits is `git log`. It shows detailed information about each commit, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

```bash
git log
```

For a more concise view, `git log --oneline` shows each commit in a single line, displaying the commit hash and the commit message.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

To view detailed information about a specific commit, use `git show <commit>`, replacing `<commit>` with the commit hash. This will display changes made in the commit, along with the commit metadata.

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git show <commit-hash>
```

## Viewing History for Specific Files

### ðŸ”¹ History of a Specific File

If you want to view the commit history for a specific file, use `git log <file>`. This will show all the commits that modified that particular file.

```bash
git log <file-name>
```

## Conclusion

Mastering these commands will allow you to navigate your project's history with ease and efficiency.
